This bug occurs when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) in Objective-C.  The observer might not be properly removed, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior after the observed object is deallocated. This is particularly tricky because the observer might be added in one part of the code and the object deallocated in another, possibly in a different thread or after a significant time delay.  A common scenario is forgetting to remove an observer in `dealloc` method. 

Example:

```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *observedString;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary<NSKeyValueChangeKey,id> *)change context:(void *)context {
  // Handle changes
}

- (void)dealloc {
  // Missing removeObserverForKeyPath, leading to a potential crash
}
@end
```
