The solution involves removing the observer in the `dealloc` method of the observing object.  Always ensure that observers are removed when they are no longer needed to avoid potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *observedString;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary<NSKeyValueChangeKey,id> *)change context:(void *)context {
  // Handle changes
}

- (void)dealloc {
  [self removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"observedString"];
}
@end
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Context:**  Using a context value in `addObserver:forKeyPath:options:context:` can help manage and track observers more effectively.
* **Error Handling:** Consider adding error handling to ensure the `removeObserver` call is successful. 
* **Thread Safety:** If observers are added or removed from multiple threads, ensure appropriate synchronization to prevent race conditions.
